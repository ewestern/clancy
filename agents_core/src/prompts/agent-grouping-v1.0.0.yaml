name: Task to Agent Grouping
version: v1.0.0

  Given these tasks, group them into logical agents that should work together, and assign a capability to each agent. 
  Each agent should have a cohesive set of responsibilities.

  Tasks: {{tasks}}

  Capability Catalog: {{capabilityCatalog}}

  Return a JSON object where keys are agent names and values are arrays of task descriptions that agent should handle:
  {{jsonSchema}}

  Guidelines:
  - If an appropriate capability does not exist, use a communication capability to pass the task to a human.
  - Group related tasks together
  - Keep agents focused on specific domains
  - Ensure good separation of concerns
  - Use descriptive agent names
