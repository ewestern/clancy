## 2 "Hire an AI Employee" wizard (collaborative & iterative)

_The wizard is a full-width modal (max-w-7xl) with a **two-pane layout** that adapts to different phases. The left pane maintains persistent chat with the AI assistant, while the right pane shows phase-specific content._

### Overall Structure
* **Full-screen modal** with rounded corners and shadow
* **Two-pane layout:**
  * **Left pane (1/3 width):** Chat interface with AI assistant for questions and feedback
  * **Right pane (2/3 width):** Dynamic content based on current phase
* **Header:** Title, description, and close button
* **Footer:** Connection status and completion button

### Phase 1 ¬∑ Job Description
* **Single-pane layout** for initial input
* Large textarea with placeholder examples
* Character count indicator (minimum 20 characters)
* **"Generate Workflows"** button with loading state
* On submit, transitions to workflows phase and initiates Graph Creator analysis

### Phase 2 ¬∑ Workflows
* **Two-pane layout** begins here
* **Left pane:** Chat interface appears for user-AI collaboration
* **Right pane:** Shows workflow analysis results
  * **Loading state:** Progress indicator with animated icons and tips
  * **Results state:** Simple workflow cards showing:
    * Workflow description
    * Numbered steps list
    * Activation conditions
* Graph Creator analyzes job description and returns structured workflows

### Phase 3 ¬∑ Connect
* **Left pane:** Continued chat for refinement and questions
* **Right pane:** Agent overview display
  * **Provider cards** generated from OAuth audit results:
    * Provider name and icon
    * Connection status (disconnected/connecting/connected)
    * **"Connect"** button opens OAuth flow in new tab
  * **Agent cards** with:
    * Agent description (human-readable)
    * Visual flow diagram instead of technical capabilities
    * Provider logos representing integrations needed
  * **Unsatisfied workflows** (if any) with explanations
* **Auto-triggers OAuth audit:** When agents are received, system calls `/oauth/audit` to identify required connections
* Transitions to ready phase when all providers are connected.

### Phase 4 ¬∑ Ready
* **Left pane:** Chat continues for final adjustments
* **Right pane:** 
  * **Final Inputs:** Provide a name for the AI Employee
  * **Agent Cards:** Continue displaying Agent Cards
  * **Completion logic:** Can proceed when name is provided.

### Interactive Elements
* **Chat interface:** 
  * Message bubbles (user vs agent styling)
  * Input field with send button
  * Processing indicator during AI responses
  * Handles Graph Creator resume events for iterative refinement

* **Provider connections:**
  * OAuth flows open in new tabs.
  * Real-time connection status updates
  * Account information display after successful connection

* **Footer status:**
  * Shows number of connected providers
  * **"üéâ Hire AI Employee"** button (enabled when requirements met)

### Backend Integration
* **Graph Creator events:** Handles `AiEmployeeStateUpdate` events with different phases
* **OAuth audit:** Automatic capability analysis for required provider connections
* **WebSocket communication:** Real-time updates for connection status and AI responses
* **Resume capability:** Users can provide feedback to refine agent configuration

### Progress Flow
1. **Job Description** ‚Üí User describes role requirements
2. **Workflows** ‚Üí AI analyzes and breaks down into automated processes  
3. **Connect** ‚Üí Shows agent flow diagrams + identifies required integrations
4. **Ready** ‚Üí User connects required providers via OAuth
5. **Complete** ‚Üí AI employee is hired and activated

_The wizard emphasizes **human-AI collaboration** through persistent chat, **visual clarity** through flow diagrams instead of technical jargon, and **seamless integration setup** through automated OAuth audit and connection flows._

  * **Footer:** message box with quick-reply buttons (Approve, Pause, Adjust schedule) as pills.

* "Retry" enqueues a RunIntent retry with same payload; "Open log" deep-links to employee Profile ‚Ä∫ Activity filtered to the failed run.

### Flow summary (how a user experiences it)

1. **Dashboard ‚ûú "Hire an employee."** Manager pastes JD, selects tools for each category, then generates the proposal and breezes through the remaining steps without touching graphs.
2. **employee goes live.** Cards update in real-time; any missing auth shows amber "Needs connect".
3. **When approval needed,** manager gets Slack DM; clicking it opens the Chat Drawer inside Clancy; they approve with one click.
4. **Knowledge grows transparently;** manager searches Knowledge Explorer and sees artefacts tagged by employee.
5. **If something breaks,** the Error Inbox pulses; they retry or open the employee's Activity tab to inspect the run trace.

**Result:** From the manager's viewpoint it feels like onboarding and supervising a real teammate‚Äîpermissions, schedules, and comms in plain language‚Äîwhile all DSL, events, and LangGraph complexity stay under the hood.
