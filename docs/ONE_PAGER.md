## Clancy — The office for autonomous agents

### What we do
Clancy is the office for autonomous agents. It turns job descriptions into AI employees that work across the software small and medium-sized businesses already use—while keeping humans safely in control with intuitive approvals and guardrails.

### Problem and customer
- **Who**: Tech‑forward SMBs (20–200 employees) who lack the time, talent, or appetite to build and maintain agent systems.
- **Why this matters**:
  - Many conflate LLM abilities with agent orchestration—drafting a letter is easy; reliably booking the flight, filing the expense, notifying the team, and updating the CRM is not.
  - Enterprise investment validates autonomous workflows; SMBs need the same outcomes with simpler packaging and faster time‑to‑value.

### Solution (at a glance)
- **AI employees from job descriptions**: Describe the role; Clancy composes an agent that starts doing real work on day one.
- **Works across existing tools**: Operates inside the software SMBs already use (email, calendar, docs, finance, chat, CRM, and others).
- **Human‑in‑the‑loop by default**: Approvals, guardrails, and auditability keep control, safety, and brand intact.

### Why now
- **Capability inflection**: Foundation models now enable reasoning and planning that make autonomous workflows practical.
- **Proven value at the top end**: Enterprises are investing; SMBs are poised to follow once the product is turnkey and safe.
- **Automation talent gap**: SMBs can’t staff agent engineering teams. Packaged “AI employees” close the gap.

### Market landscape
- **Incumbent strength**: Tools like Zapier and n8n have distribution, integrations, and a graph‑builder mindset.
- **Where they win**: If “agentic automation” remains incremental features inside legacy workflow builders.

### Why we win
- **Outcome‑first, not graph‑first**: We deliver role outcomes (“AP Clerk”, “Sales Coordinator”) instead of asking users to design automations.
- **Time‑to‑value**: Start from a job description; see results immediately—no complex graph construction required.
- **Safety & trust**: Intuitive approvals, guardrails, and auditability make adoption safe for SMBs.
- **Compounding leverage**: AI employees learn within role boundaries, improving over time without user micromanagement.

### Business model and scale path
- **Pricing**: Subscription plus an "automation minutes" surcharge as a proxy for model usage (capacity to get work done).
- **Unit economics**: If a typical SMB realizes $1k–$2k in monthly savings, $3k–$10k ARR per customer is rational.
- **Scale to $300M+**: ~60k customers at a ~$5k blended ARR yields $300M+ ARR.

### Go‑to‑market
- **Beachhead personas**: Operations, finance, revenue ops, and admin roles where repetitive, cross‑tool tasks dominate.
- **Land & expand**: Start with one role (e.g., “Billing Assistant”), then expand horizontally (sales ops, scheduling, vendor mgmt).
- **Channels**: App marketplaces, Partner with MSPs serving SMBs, and promoting template libraries tied to common job descriptions.

### What success looks like
- **Immediate**: An SMB describes a role; within hours, an AI employee executes approved tasks across email, calendar, docs, chat, and finance.
- **Near‑term**: Library of turnkey AI employees for the most common SMB roles; measurable time savings and error reduction.
- **Long‑term**: A compounding workforce of AI employees augmenting every business function, safely managed from one place.

### Ask
We’re raising to accelerate customer onboarding, expand the AI employee's capabilities, and deepen approvals/guardrails—so every SMB can put autonomous agents to work, safely and fast.
