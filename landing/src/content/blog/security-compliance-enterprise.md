# Enterprise Security & Compliance: How Clancy Keeps Your Data Safe

When deploying digital employees in enterprise environments, security isn't optionalâ€”it's fundamental. Here's how Clancy ensures your data remains protected while delivering powerful automation capabilities.

## Zero Trust Architecture

Clancy operates on a zero-trust security model:

### Identity & Access Management
- **SSO Integration**: Seamless integration with Auth0, Okta, and Azure AD
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Required for all administrative access
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for different user types
- **Just-in-Time Access**: Temporary credentials that expire automatically

### Network Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Private Cloud Deployment**: Available for enterprise customers
- **API Gateway Protection**: Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- **VPC Isolation**: Complete network segregation for enterprise instances

## Compliance Certifications

We maintain rigorous compliance standards:

### Current Certifications
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Comprehensive security controls audit
- **GDPR Compliant**: European data protection regulations
- **HIPAA Ready**: Healthcare data protection measures
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management systems

### In Progress
- **SOX Compliance**: Financial reporting controls
- **FedRAMP**: Government cloud security standards
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry standards

## Data Protection & Privacy

### Data Minimization
Clancy only accesses the minimum data required for task execution:

```javascript
// Example: Customer onboarding task
const requiredData = {
  customerName: "essential",
  email: "essential", 
  fullProfile: "not_accessed",
  paymentDetails: "not_accessed"
};
```

### Audit Logging
Every action is logged and traceable:
- **Who**: Which digital employee performed the action
- **What**: Detailed description of the action taken
- **When**: Precise timestamp with timezone
- **Where**: Source system and destination
- **Why**: Original business request that triggered the action

### Data Residency
- **Regional Control**: Choose where your data is processed and stored
- **Cross-Border Protection**: Automatic compliance with data sovereignty laws
- **Deletion Guarantees**: Complete data removal upon request

## Integration Security

### OAuth 2.0 Flow
Clancy never stores your raw credentials:

1. **Authorization Request**: User authorizes Clancy to access specific systems
2. **Secure Token Exchange**: Clancy receives limited-scope access tokens
3. **Encrypted Storage**: Tokens stored with AES-256 encryption
4. **Automatic Rotation**: Tokens refreshed before expiration

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and ensures system stability
- **Request Signing**: Cryptographic verification of all API calls
- **Webhook Validation**: Secure handling of inbound system notifications

## Incident Response

### 24/7 Security Monitoring
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate notification of security events
- **Automated Response**: Instant containment of detected threats
- **Human Oversight**: Security team review of all alerts

### Business Continuity
- **99.9% Uptime SLA**: Guaranteed availability for enterprise customers
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region backup and failover
- **Data Backup**: Continuous backup with point-in-time recovery

## Enterprise Deployment Options

### Cloud Deployment
- **Shared Tenancy**: Cost-effective for most organizations
- **Dedicated Tenancy**: Isolated infrastructure for sensitive workloads
- **Private Cloud**: Complete infrastructure isolation

### On-Premises Deployment
- **Air-Gapped Installation**: For maximum security environments
- **Hybrid Connectivity**: Secure bridge between on-prem and cloud systems
- **Custom Security Controls**: Integration with existing security infrastructure
